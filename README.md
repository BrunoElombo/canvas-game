# Tennis Game

## Overview
This project is a simple 2D tennis game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control two characters on a canvas, trying to hit a bouncing ball back and forth. The game keeps track of each player's score, and the first player to reach a certain score wins.

## How to Play
1. **Controls**:
   - **Player 1 (Left Side)**:
     - Move Left: `Arrow Left` or `Left`
     - Move Right: `Arrow Right` or `Right`
     - Move Up: `Arrow Up` or `Up`
     - Move Down: `Arrow Down` or `Down`
   - **Player 2 (Right Side)**:
     - Move Left: `A`
     - Move Right: `D`
     - Move Up: `W`
     - Move Down: `S`
   - **Pause/Resume Game**: Press the `Space` key.

2. **Objective**:
   - Hit the ball back and forth without letting it pass your side of the court. Each time the ball passes the opponent, the other player scores a point.
